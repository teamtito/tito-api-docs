# Introduction

Welcome to the Tito API!

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'tito'
Tito.api_key = 'YOUR-API-KEY'
```

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.tito.io/v2/...' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR-API-KEY' \
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your API key.

Tito uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can find your API key by signing in at [https://api.tito.io](https://api.tito.io).

Your API key needs to included in the `Authorization` header so your requests can be authenticated, see the examples to the right:
